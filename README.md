## How It Was Created

1. **HTML**: The base file `index.html` provides the container for the to-do list, including a form to add tasks and an empty `<ul>` element to hold the task list. The page also links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.
   
2. **CSS**: The `styles.css` file styles the app, giving it a modern, minimalistic appearance with responsive design elements to enhance usability across devices.

3. **JavaScript**: The `script.js` file contains the logic for managing the to-do list. Key functions include:
   - Dynamically adding tasks to the list.
   - Assigning a delete button to each task for easy removal.
   - Updating the DOM (Document Object Model) in real time for a smooth and interactive experience.
